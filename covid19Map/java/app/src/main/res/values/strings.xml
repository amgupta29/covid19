        It feels good to know that you care about the situation and are taking the responsibility
        to work for it. The app shows the people who has marked themselves within a radius of 100
        meters which is small enough to tell the area you should avoid at the same time it is big
        enough to keep them anonymous.\n
        \n Worried about your data? : \n
        * We do not take any data from you that can be traced back to you.
        * We do not store any data longer than needed to compute information for this app.
        <br>\n\n How does it work? : \n</br>
        * The app shows the location of people who have marked themselves as COVID19 infected in a
        RED color circle with a red marker. \n
        * The app shows the location of people who have marked themselves as Flu infected in a
        YELLOW color circle with an orange marker. \n
        * The app updates the location every 10 mins if you have marked yourself.
